# FirstBlogProject

## This is my first blog project I made using node/express/ejs.

### Instructions

To run locally download source code and install Node.js.

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to where you put the source code

Install dependencies:

`npm i express body-parser ejs lodash`

Use this command to run it locally:

`node app.js`

OR

install nodemon

`npm i nodemon`

Then just run nodemon and that should work

`nodemon`

Open web browser and navigate to https://localhost:3000 to view
